  <h1>Spotlight on Vintage - Luxury Italian Leather Manufacturers</h1>
<p>Having spent nearly 3 years looking at secondhand clothing, and spent well in excess of 10000 euros/pounds/dollars on clothes in the hope of selling it on (and not keeping too much in the process), I've tried to look for patterns that emerge.</p>

<p>One helpful, but not always entirely accurate metric, is brand name. When you buy from X brand, you're usually buying into some level of quality, and you pay a premium for that. Since vintage prices are significantly more volatile and elastic than you would find in a retail environment, it's clear to see some things bubble up, and some things don't - a stylised Gucci skirt from the Tom Ford era is far more likely to command high prices than a plain wool Gucci skirt from the 80s.</p>

<p>So it would seem the market tends to, on the whole, organise itself pretty well. Except it doesn't, and I think that's an interesting topic to delve into at some point - how can we get much more of the stock currently sitting on secondhand clothing websites to move, through a number of ways but particularly through more precise pricing?</p>

<p>For now though, it's worthwhile to highlight one type of vintage which is often overlooked, is fairly available, and can offer huge savings to retail. I've named the category "luxury Italian manufacturers" since it highlights that these brands - first and foremost - were the names behind a lot of the high end clothing production coming out of Italy particularly towards the end of the 20th Century: think supple leather jackets, fully hand-made suits, gorgeous silks, and incredible knitwear.</p>

<p>And before continuing, a quick note: there's definitely plenty available for women as well. Admittedly my knowledge on women's vintage is not as strong as it is for men's, but there's certainly something for everyone here.</p>

<p>The rest of this article will share some of the manufacturers I've learned about, and what you can expect from each. Happy thrifting!</p>

<h3> Schiatti & C.</h3>
<p>Founded in the 1940s, Schiatti & C. has been a recent discovery of mine, and unfortunately, a little late: the company went out of business sometime in the 2010s. Between those years, though, it produced its own excellent line of luxury jackets (both in leather and more basic materials) and knitwear. </p>

<p>Their work for Bijan, Brioni, and Stefano Ricci (what I refer to as 'oligarch-core') is much better known, and given pieces from those brands retail at prices with a few too many zeros for comfort, there is a certain seal of approval.</p>

<p>I have been lucky enough to find a chunky Bijan cardigan produced by Schiatti in the 1980s, and it embodies exactly what you'd expect from the maker: great construction, great fabrics, and a certain flair missing from a lot of other vintage.</p>

<h3> La Matta</h3>
<p>It's not particularly easy to find much information on La Matta online, other than one reference on StyleForum claiming that they used to produce the leather jackets for Ralph Lauren's highest end line, Purple Label. I'm inclined to believe that, given that I've own suede jackets from both brands. With La Matta, what you get is a specialism in lightweight leather skins unlike the very particular image of a tough, slightly-dried-out leather of a typical vintage jacket.</p>

<p>Lastly, while this isn't unique to La Matta, it's worth noting: the actual size of the leather panels tends to be bigger with these Italian manufacturers. Getting a large surface area of unblemished leather hide is hard enough as is, so it follows that trying to replicate this at scale must be particularly challenging. Today, even supposedly at the highest level at thousands of dollars, have a look at product shots and notice where the seams are placed for leather jackets - particularly on the back. Forgive me for the image conjured, but sometimes there is a real challenge of the size of the hide when it comes to younger animals. In many other cases, though, you might be getting a product that isn't necessarily produced to the same standards as a lot of these heritage Italian manufacturers.</p>

<h3> Other leather outerwear manufacturers </h3>
<p>With these brands, I don't have as much background information, but it's still valuable to include them.</p>
<ul><li>Hettabretz</li>
  <li>Alfredo Rifugio</li>
  <li>Lavabre Cadet (technically a French glovemaker, but I have occasionally spotted some lambskin leather jackets online)</li></ul>

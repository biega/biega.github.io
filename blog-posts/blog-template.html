  <h1> My Favourite Brands to Thrift</h1>
  <p>Some of my favourite brands to look out for when looking at second-hand clothing</p>
   <ol type="1">
     <li>Margaret Howell, MHL - a seemingly evergreen brand with a focus on fabrics and fit. Look out for older knitwear made by Marion Foale, interesting cuts, or anything else from her - it's all great stuff</li>
     <li>Oska - a German Lagenlook brand, focused on loose, flowing silhouettes. The boiled wools by Moessmer and wide-leg trousers are particularly great</li>
     <li>TOAST (including OAS) - though not hugely expensive at retail, the soft and feminine workwear/practical-chic slant captures the trend towards comfort</li>
     <li>Drake's - The "thing" in menswear circles in recent years, it's very possible to find a bargain on these pieces given how niche it is</li>
     <li>Luca Faloni - a direct-to-consumer cashmere specialist. Shirts are also great from experience.</li>
     <li>Haider Ackermann - not the easiest find, but look out for a large black rectangular logo and you could be in for a treat. Decidely NOT cheap.</li>
     <li>Ann Demeulemeester - it's all about the colour black and their incredible boots</li>
     <li>Universal Works, Albam, Folk - well-made workwear styles serving the mid-range market well. The latter two do sometimes manufacture expressly for TKMaxx, so quality won't always be the same</li>
     <li>Incotex - Italian trouser specialist. New goes for over Â£250</li>
     <li>Mr P - Mr Porter's own brand, with a strong offering of essentials</li>
     <li>Orlebar Brown, Vilebrequin, Frescobol Carioca - high-end resortwear from UK, France, and Brazil respectively</li>
     <li>Derek Rose - high-end loungewear, casual basics, and underwear</li>
     <li>James Perse - high quality, high price (at retail), and very understated styling</li>
  </ol>
